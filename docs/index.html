<h4>Purpose of KUCINO</h4>
To expand Guru Network's current Casino beyond it's proof-of-concept state and explore third-party oracle based betting on real life events like "who will win tomorrow's (xyz) football match?" or "will Bitcoin cross 100k on new year's eve?". Owing to it's experimental nature, we're keeping it on a separate chain for the time being and it will replace our current setup on Fantom once it matures.
<br><br>
<h4>Specifics about KUCINO token</h4>
A max supply of 42 billion, out of which 39 will be vested to linearly unlock for 100 years to fund ecosytem incentives, 1 billion will be distributed via a presale & 1 billion will be added to liquidity. Another 1 billion will be paid out as farming rewards.
<br><br>
<h4>What do the ELITEs get?</h4>
ALL ELITE HOLDERS WILL GET A FREE KUCINO AIRDROP!<br>
Snapshot will be taken before the <b><u><a href="ftm.guru/yieldstate" target="blank">YieldState</a></u></b>'s Exponential Rewards Program goes live this weekend.

How does it help GURU Network?
Kucino is a Casino. There will be a multitude of games where anyone bets some token to win some more tokens. A small tax will be levied by the house from the winning tokens earned by the players. This tax will be converted to KCS and go to buyback KUCINO, raising it's price continuously, as well as reducing it's supply slowly and steadily. A part from this will also be added to the ELITE DAO treasury, which is basically going to be shared by ELITE holders.


This is a first step in making ELITE the governance token of GURU Network that benefits from each product we launch. Kucino website will be launching soon this weekend. As of now, the pre-sale is live and we've met over 60% of our soft-cap. You can visit the community group at t.me/KUCINO.

	<b>Presale: Update</b><br><br>
	Our partner DEX has requested a time window to review certain aspects about our partnership after the soft-cap was achieved swiftly, unexpectedly. In view of this delay, we will have to delay the launch to Sunday. The hard-cap will be a cutoff based value at Sunday 12am UTC, 48hours from this announcement.<br><br>
	Please note that the maximum contribution limit is 13.37 KCS from each address. Any and all excess will be refunded to the source.
