<h1>Welcome to KUCINO</h1>
<div class="mainstage" align="center" style="font-size:">
<h2>Tokenomics</h2>
Holders of KUCINO token earn KCS and KUCINO, both, on each transaction. Beyond this, all transactions also help increase the liquidity, which in turn raises the price floor.
<br><br><h3>Earn KCS</h3>
A part of each transction goes into a KCS pool, which is claimable by every holder of KUCINO token once every cycle. Holders can claim an amount equivalnet to their network share in Kucino.<br>
<b>KCS Earned = (KCS in pool) x (KUCINO held) / (circ. supply)</b>
<br><br><h3>Anti-whale</h3>
Kucino also protects against a concept known as "disruptive transfers", or whale moves. Transfering huge amounts will not be permited by default, but whales can use the "disruptive transfer" method to move big funds by paying a small fees of 100 KCS ;)
<br><br><h3>Zero balance penalty</h3>
Many dumpers have the habit of selecting "max" when dumping their tokens. We introduce a time-penalty and such users will have to wait for decades to claim their KCS.
<br><br><h3>Earn KCS 2: The KCS jackpot</h3>
Every once in a while, few users will be rewarded a jackpot claim, which will be an amount of KCS significantly greater than their expected earnings!<br>We recommend everyone to turn on notifications from our website and claim at the earliest of your cycle.
<br><br><h3>Reflection Rewards</h3>
Each transaction will also include a KUCINO reward, distributed evenly to all holders using the famous concept known as reflection.
<br><br><h3>Burn the KUCINO?</h3>
As a premier Casino operator, we know the real value of money. Something thats insignificant to someone might mean the world to someone else. For this reason, instead of burning KUCINO tokens, we will distribute KUCINO as airdrops to multiple communities supporting us. This sum will be raised per tx.
<br><br><h3>Drain the Pot</h3>
A part of each transaction will also be used to fund a jackpot ("KuPot") where anyone can bet 0.1 KCS to drain half of the pot. The KSC raised will partly go to the KSC pool, which is claimable by KUCINO holders. Another part will fund another jackpot, "The Re-Roller".
<br><br><h3>The Re-Roller</h3>
KSC raised from "The KuPot" will fund a jackpot that only 1-million KUCINO holders can enter. The ticket will cost 0.1 KCS and the reward will be half of the balance of The Re-Roller.
<br><br><h3>Marketing & Dev funds</h3>
Each transaction will also send a small part to a marketing & dev fund, which we will utilise to run more games and create partnerships with other projects. These games would utilize the token from the partner project to win a KCS or the project's token based jackpot.

<h2>About this project</h2>
<h4>Purpose of KUCINO</h4>
To expand Guru Network's current Casino beyond it's proof-of-concept state and explore third-party oracle based betting on real life events like "who will win tomorrow's (xyz) football match?" or "will Bitcoin cross 100k on new year's eve?". Owing to it's experimental nature, we're keeping it on a separate chain for the time being and it will replace our current setup on Fantom once it matures.
<br><br>
<h4>Specifics about KUCINO token</h4>
A max supply of 42 billion, out of which 39 will be vested to linearly unlock for 100 years to fund ecosytem incentives, 1 billion will be distributed via a presale & 1 billion will be added to liquidity. Another 1 billion will be paid out as farming rewards.
<br><br>
<h4>What do the ELITEs get?</h4>
ALL ELITE HOLDERS WILL GET A FREE KUCINO AIRDROP!<br>
Snapshot will be taken before the <b><u><a href="https://ftm.guru/yieldstate" target="blank">YieldState</a></u></b>'s Exponential Rewards Program goes live this weekend.
<br><br>
<h4>How does it help GURU Network?</h4>
Kucino is a Casino. There will be a multitude of games where anyone bets some token to win some more tokens. A small tax will be levied by the house from the winning tokens earned by the players. This tax will be converted to KCS and go to buyback KUCINO, raising it's price continuously, as well as reducing it's supply slowly and steadily. A part from this will also be added to the ELITE DAO treasury, which is basically going to be shared by ELITE holders.
<br><br>
<h4>The Ecosytem at large</h4>
This is a first step in making ELITE the governance token of GURU Network that benefits from each product we launch. Kucino website will be launching soon this weekend. As of now, the pre-sale is over with a successful raise of 2,104 KCS!
<br><br>
<h4 align="center">Proof-of-Concept Dapps</h4>
Our first proof-of-concept is live at <b><u><a href="casino.html">our Kucoin Chain Casino</u></b>. Already 18 Jackpots had been won at the time of print! Also check out our <u><b><a href="https://ftm.guru/degam" target="blank">Casino on Fantom Opera</a></u></b> blockchain. It has been running live for weeks with dozens of jackpots being won each week!
